# Cryptocurrencies

In this project we created an analysis for clients who are getting ready to enter the bitcoin market to put all these skills to use.
We created a report that lists the cryptocurrencies that are available for trade 

Since the data was not optimal, we processed in order for the machine learning models to fit. We chose to employ unsupervised learning and a clustering algorithm to organize the cryptocurrency.
